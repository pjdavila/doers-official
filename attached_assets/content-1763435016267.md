#### Joshua Newman   Co-Founder Platik

I've been able to go from zero mobile development experience to building an app for my startup ready for beta release in 3 months with Galaxies.

Galaxies is some of the best software engineering learning content I've come across in my ten years of engineering experience. The content is **practical** and always engaging. I am extremely glad I managed to find Galaxies when I was first researching mobile technologies several months ago.

#### Luis Lopez   Developer

Galaxies is a really well-paced course for React Native. I am a beginner mobile developer and have learned a lot, even from the first section of the course. Highly recommended!
